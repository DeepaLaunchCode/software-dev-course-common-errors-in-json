üè® JSON Syntax Debugging: Hotel Booking Data
===========================================

üéØ Objective:
Students will analyze a JSON file containing multiple syntax errors,
identify the issues, and correct them.

This activity helps practice spotting and fixing common JSON mistakes such as:
- Missing commas
- Incorrect use of quotation marks
- Unmatched brackets/braces
- Trailing commas
- Invalid data types

// üß≠ Instructions:
// ============================================

/*
üìò Scenario:
You‚Äôre a developer on a team building a travel booking API.

A teammate submitted a JSON file to represent a hotel booking, 
but it contains multiple syntax errors that prevent it from being parsed.

üîß Your Task:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Review the provided JSON file
2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify all syntax errors
3Ô∏è‚É£ Write down what each error is and why it causes a problem
4Ô∏è‚É£ Correct the JSON structure so that it is valid
5Ô∏è‚É£ Validate your corrected version using a JSON linter or validator

üß™ Deliverables:
- A corrected version of the JSON
- A list of the corrections made and why each was necessary

// ============================================
// ‚úÖ Requirements
// ============================================

/*
- Use a JSON validator or linter (e.g., https://jsonlint.com/) to test your final version
- Keep track of each fix:
  ‚Ä¢ What was wrong?
  ‚Ä¢ Why is it a problem in JSON?
  ‚Ä¢ What did you change to fix it?
*/
/*Here is my understandin
Error 1-Missing comma after "checkInDate": "2024-05-15". A comma is required to separate it from "checkOutDate".

Error 2-Invalid value undefined in the "age" field of the second guest ("age": undefined). JSON does not allow 
undefined as a value; it should be a number, string, boolean, object, array, or null.

Error 3-Invalid email format in the second guest's "email": "bob.smith@example". The email lacks a valid top-level domain (e.g., .com, .org).

Error 4-Trailing comma in the "amenities" array (["WiFi", "Breakfast", "Parking",]). JSON does not allow trailing commas at the end of arrays or objects.

// ü§î Follow-Up Questions
// ============================================
/*

üí¨ Reflect and answer the following:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What tools or techniques did you use to identify the errors?
I used jsonlint and VS studio for this 
2Ô∏è‚É£ How did you confirm that your corrected JSON file was valid?
I have tested on format, visually verified the file and tested with tools 
3Ô∏è‚É£ Which errors were the most difficult to spot? Why?
syntax error as this contains all datatypes

4Ô∏è‚É£ What strategies can help you avoid these kinds of errors in the future?
   (e.g., syntax highlighting, linters, writing JSON by example)
   will suggest visual validation first and lintner.
